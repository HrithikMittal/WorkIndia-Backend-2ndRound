# Test Data:

As I host everything on cloud So If you want to test it directly without installing the code you can test with the following credentials:

```json
{
    "username":"adhikashmittal@gmail.com",
    "password":"password@123"
}
```

do the login and Please <b>Note down your token as well as your id(user Id) for future APIs</b>.

# Description:

I deploy the app on the heroku Platform and the MySQL is hosted on AWS server. If you want to change it please change it in environment file. Also the link for heroku app: [https://workindia.herokuapp.com/](https://workindia.herokuapp.com/)

``https://workindia.herokuapp.com/``

for sake of convenience of usage and checking the API I host it on POSTMAN also you can run it directly from there:

[https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5665978/T1DjkfEM?version=latest](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5665978/T1DjkfEM?version=latest)

For hashing the password of user I use [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) and for the encryption and decryption is done by using [cryptr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryptr)

# How to run:

To run the App please follow the steps mention below in your terminal :

1. Download the zip file.
2. npm install.
3. Setup your SQL Database in your local system and Create a DB ``workindia``. (*It will run at ``localhost`` and ``user:root `` and ``password:''``*) [As of now it is hosted on AWS RDS.]
4. ```node index.js ``` or ```nodemon.```

```javascript
DB setup succesfully
ðŸš€Server is running on PORT:4040
```

Now your server will be running on the ```localhost:4040```.

##### CAUTION: 

Here I create env file with the name ``.env`` if you want to change the ``PORT`` ,`` JWT_SECRET``,`` Database Name``,``Database Username `` and``Database Password``  you can do it from there.



# APIs

*(I also create the postman docs of using API so you can check that too: [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5665978/T1DjkfEM?version=latest](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5665978/T1DjkfEM?version=latest)*

*base url: ``http://localhost:4040/app``*

##### NOTE: All the Request body will be JSON Object

Please also take note of your ``id`` at the signup(User) So It will be use in later on APIs. Otherwise you can take thoose APIs from backend also means Database Schema.
