# Description:

I deploy the app on the heroku Platform and the MySQL is hosted on AWS server. If you want to change it please change it in environment file. 

# How to run:

To run the App please follow the steps mention below in your terminal :

1. Download the zip file.
2. npm install.
3. Setup your SQL Database in your local system and Create a DB ``workindia``. (*It will run at ``localhost`` and ``user:root `` and ``password:''``*) [As of now it is hosted on AWS RDS.]
4. ```node index.js ``` or ```nodemon.```

```javascript
DB setup succesfully
ðŸš€Server is running on PORT:4040
```

Now your server will be running on the ```localhost:4040```.

##### CAUTION: 

Here I create env file with the name ``.env`` if you want to change the ``PORT`` ,`` JWT_SECRET``,`` Database Name``,``Database Username `` and``Database Password``  you can do it from there.



# APIs

*(I also create the postman docs of using API so you can check that too: [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5665978/T1DjkfEM?version=latest](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5665978/T1DjkfEM?version=latest)*

*base url: ``http://localhost:4040``*

##### NOTE: All the Request body will be JSON Object

Please also take note of your ``id`` at the signup(User) So It will be use in later on APIs. Otherwise you can take thoose APIs from backend also means Database Schema.
